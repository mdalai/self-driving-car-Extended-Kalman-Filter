# self-driving-car-Extended-Kalman-Filter
Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree Term2 Project 1
# Purpose
**Main Purpose**: learn how to track car or biker around the self driving car with Lidar and Randar. Tracking means:
* where the object is: **Position**.
* and how fast the object is moving: **Velocity**.

**In order to solve this problem I have to learn:**
* Kalman Filter: the algorithm that serves for tracking the object.
* C++: tracking process has to be fast. The prediction result has to respond in real time, so that car would not hit the object around. This requires a fast programming language C++.
* How LiDar and Radar measure. 

**Udacity Self Driving Car Extended Kalman Filter project exactly serves for this purpose.**
